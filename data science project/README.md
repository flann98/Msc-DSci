This project aims to compare a custom Neural Network model with a traditional 1 dimensional CNN and a Natural Language Processing (LSTM) model for the prediction of protein structures from the genome of E. coli.

Dataset used is the e.coli proteome from the AlphaFold structures downloads page: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download

Required modules:
os, gzip, shutil, BioPython, networkx, numpy, csv, scipy.stats, matplotlib, torch_geometric, random, pandas, torch, mpl_toolkits.
